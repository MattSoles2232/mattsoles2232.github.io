    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Compound Bros. was founded by brothers Matt and Anthony Soles — two passionate food lovers with a mission to turn simple meals into unforgettable experiences. What began as weekend cooking experiments soon evolved into a shared obsession with flavor, texture, and the perfect finishing touch: compound butter.
      </p>
      <p>
        We realized that something as simple as butter could be transformed into a powerhouse of flavor when infused with herbs, spices, and fresh ingredients — and so, the idea for Compound Bros. was born. From savory blends like Garlic & Herb or Smoked Chipotle to sweet favorites like Maple Cinnamon, every recipe is handcrafted in small batches using only real, high-quality ingredients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our commitment to excellence goes beyond what’s in the jar. As a family-run business, we take pride in every detail — from sourcing to packaging — ensuring that each butter not only tastes amazing, but tells a story of care, creativity, and culinary passion. Whether you're grilling, roasting, baking, or simply spreading, our butters are designed to enhance your meals and spark conversation at the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Compound Bros., we don’t just make butter — we make food better.
